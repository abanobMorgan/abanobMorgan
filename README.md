-👋 Hi, I’m Abanob Kammal Attalla Morgan   
- 🌱 I currently work as an NLP engineer at RDI.
I’m a Natural Language Processing Engineer with over 2 years of hands-on experience building intelligent language models and backend infrastructure for AI-driven applications.  
My work has spanned advanced sentiment analysis,  
generative chatbots using local LLMs,  
and production-ready API services for deploying NLP pipelines.  
**Highlights of my experience include:**
🚀 Developed generative LLM-based chatbots using Hugging Face transformers and LangGraph, improving user engagement by 30%.
🧠 Built custom NLP models for entity recognition and sentiment analysis, reducing false positives and increasing accuracy.
🛠️ Created Dockerized FastAPI/Flask services for scalable ML model deployment, integrated with CI/CD pipelines.
📊 Applied model evaluation strategies including precision, recall, and F1, with strong experience in hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
🌐 Familiar with cloud platforms like GCP for model training and deployment.
📚 Certified in IBM Data Science, DeepLearning.AI, and Mathematics for ML.

I’m especially passionate about large language models (LLMs),  
Also, I’m eager to contribute to innovative NLP solutions in real-world production environments.
