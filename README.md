I’m a Natural Language Processing Engineer with over 2 years of hands-on experience building intelligent language models and backend infrastructure for AI-driven applications.  
My work has spanned advanced sentiment analysis, generative chatbots using local LLMs,  
and production-ready API services for deploying NLP pipelines.  
**Highlights of my experience include:**  
🚀 Developed generative LLM-based chatbots using Hugging Face transformers and LangGraph, improving user engagement by 30%.  
🧠 Built custom NLP models for entity recognition and sentiment analysis, reducing false positives and increasing accuracy.  
🛠️ Created Dockerized FastAPI/Flask services for scalable ML model deployment, integrated with CI/CD pipelines.  
📊 Applied model evaluation strategies including precision, recall, and F1, with strong experience in hyperparameter tuning and optimization.  
🌐 Familiar with cloud platforms like GCP for model training and deployment.  
📚 Certified in IBM Data Science, DeepLearning.AI, and Mathematics for ML.  

I’m especially passionate about large language models (LLMs),  
Also, I’m eager to contribute to innovative NLP solutions in real-world production environments.
